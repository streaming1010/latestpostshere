When to choose a garden tractor?

Lawn tractors are increasingly popular devices used not only by specialized companies or municipal services, but also by private garden owners. The small size and own drive make using the tractor significantly faster mowing and allows you to work in a comfortable, seated position. The advantage of this type of device is of course much more and you could exchange them for a long time.

Traktor mowers are devices ideal for the care of large lawns. The wide working body significantly shortens the working time, while comfortable sitting gives great comfort at the same time.

<h2">What does a garden tractor do?</h2>
Contrary to appearances, the garden tractor has a number of practical applications. Good-quality garden tractors can easily be used not only as a mower, but also are successfully used, for example, as snow plows.

The garden tractor is an ideal device for owners of large gardens. It is undeniable that the use of this type of machine allows you to save time and extremely efficient work. That is why grass tractors have been gaining popularity in recent years and have ceased to be an accessory reserved only for owners of large villas. Affordable prices are now only an additional advantage, which slightly loses its importance compared to high functionality. When choosing a garden tractor, follow some important criteria that will allow you to make the right decision.

<h2>ALL SIZES ARE</h2>

When browsing various models of self-propelled mowers, as garden tractors are called in a different way, their basic parameters are of key importance, such as: engine power, cutting width, type of drive and fuel tank capacity. They are all closely related to the surface of your garden - the larger it is, the more efficient the mower will be with the higher values of these attributes.

The engine power generates the tractor's work speed. The large working width of the device will allow you to cut more grass in one pass. A suitable and solid drive will prove to be particularly important if your lawn is on uneven ground and more specifically - the area to be mowed. Suggesting the performance of individual types of mowers, approximate standards were established between the type of mowing machine and the size of the lawn. If its size does not exceed 50 m2, a hand mower will be sufficient. In the range from 50 m2 to 500 m2 usually the best results can be achieved using an electric mower. Lawns over 500 m2 are a perfect field for petrol lawn mowers users.

Gardening tractors are recommended primarily for gardens with an area of ​​over 1000 m2. A lawn of this size is too large to be mowed, e.g. with a petrol lawn mower. It would take too much time and be too laborious. Ride-on mower is adapted to almost wholesale work - it allows mowing grass up to 122 cm wide. It is much more than any other petrol or electric model. Therefore, if you have a large garden and you want to save time, a garden tractor will be the perfect solution for you.
